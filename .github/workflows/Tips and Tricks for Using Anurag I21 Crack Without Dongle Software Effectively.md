Anurag I21 is a popular and versatile Photoshop plugin that allows you to retouch, adjust and edit photos with ease. It has many features and tools that can enhance your photos and make them look more professional. However, Anurag I21 is not a free software and requires a dongle to run. A dongle is a small device that plugs into your computer's USB port and acts as a security key for the software. Without the dongle, you cannot use Anurag I21.
