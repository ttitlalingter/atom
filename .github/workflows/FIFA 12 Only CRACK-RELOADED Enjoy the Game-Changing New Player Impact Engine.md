FIFA 12 is one of the most popular soccer games of all time, but it requires a DVD to run. If you want to play FIFA 12 without a DVD, you have a few options. Here are some of them:
 
- Use a virtual drive. A virtual drive is a software that creates a virtual DVD on your computer. You can mount an image file of FIFA 12 on the virtual drive and play it as if you had a real DVD. Some of the most popular virtual drive programs are Daemon Tools, PowerISO and Alcohol 120%. To use a virtual drive, you need to download an image file of FIFA 12 from a reliable source, such as [Softonic](https://fifa-12.en.softonic.com/) [^2^]. Then, install the virtual drive program and follow its instructions to mount the image file. You may need to adjust some settings in FIFA 12 to make it recognize the virtual drive as a DVD.
- Use a no-DVD patch. A no-DVD patch is a file that modifies the game's executable to bypass the DVD check. You can download a no-DVD patch for FIFA 12 from [MegaGames](https://megagames.com/download/238946/0) [^3^]. To use a no-DVD patch, you need to copy the file to your FIFA 12 installation folder and replace the original executable. You may need to backup the original executable in case you want to restore it later. You may also need to disable your antivirus program or add an exception for the patch file, as some antivirus programs may detect it as a virus.
- Use Origin. Origin is EA's digital distribution platform that allows you to download and play EA games without a DVD. You can buy FIFA 12 from Origin or redeem your DVD code if you already have one. To use Origin, you need to create an account and install the Origin client on your computer. Then, you can browse the Origin store and purchase or redeem FIFA 12. You can also access other features of Origin, such as online multiplayer, achievements and cloud saves.

These are some of the ways you can play FIFA 12 without a DVD. However, be aware that these methods may not be legal or ethical in some countries or regions. You should always respect the intellectual property rights of EA and other game developers. You should also avoid downloading files from untrusted sources or websites that may contain malware or viruses. Playing FIFA 12 without a DVD is at your own risk and responsibility.

## What are the main features of FIFA 12?
 
FIFA 12 is a football simulation game that offers a realistic and immersive experience of the sport. FIFA 12 introduces three major gameplay changes that make it different from previous versions: the impact engine, tactical defending and precision dribbling. These features affect the way players interact with each other and with the ball, making the game more dynamic and challenging.
 
### The impact engine
 
The impact engine is a new physics engine that improves the collision variety, accuracy and momentum preservation in FIFA 12. It allows for more natural and believable outcomes in every contact between players, whether they are tackling, jumping, sliding or colliding. The impact engine also affects the injuries sustained by players during a match, making them more realistic and dependent on the type and intensity of the collision. The impact engine has been described as a game changer by the developers and critics, as it makes FIFA 12 less predictable and more responsive than its predecessors.
 
### Tactical defending
 
Tactical defending is a new system that changes the way players defend in FIFA 12. It places equal importance on positioning, intercepting passes and tackling, making defending more skillful and meaningful than before. Players have to time their challenges carefully and use their intelligence to anticipate the moves of the attackers. Tactical defending also requires more teamwork and communication among defenders, as they have to cover each other and coordinate their actions. Tactical defending has been praised for adding more depth and realism to FIFA 12, but also criticized for being too difficult and frustrating for some players.
 
### Precision dribbling
 
Precision dribbling is a new feature that enhances the control and creativity of players on the ball in FIFA 12. It allows players to dribble with more finesse and accuracy in tight spaces, giving them more time to make decisions and more options to beat defenders. Precision dribbling also enables players to perform more tricks and skills with ease, making the game more fun and entertaining. Precision dribbling has been applauded for giving more freedom and expression to players in FIFA 12, but also warned for being overpowered and unrealistic in some situations.
