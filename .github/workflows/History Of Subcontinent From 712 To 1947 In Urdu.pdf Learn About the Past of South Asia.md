## The Advent of Islam in the Subcontinent and the Arab Conquest of Sind in 712
 
The first contact between the Muslims and the people of the subcontinent occurred during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the 7th century CE. He sent some of his companions to seek refuge in Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia), where they met a Christian king who was friendly to them. He also sent letters to various rulers of the subcontinent, inviting them to Islam. Some of them responded positively, while others ignored or rejected his message.
 
The first military expedition of the Muslims to the subcontinent was led by Muhammad bin Qasim, a young general sent by Hajjaj bin Yusuf, the governor of Iraq, in 712 CE. He was ordered to avenge the attack on a Muslim ship by pirates near Debal (modern-day Karachi) and to rescue the Muslim prisoners and merchants who were captured by them. He successfully conquered Debal and then proceeded to capture other cities and regions in Sind and Multan, establishing Muslim rule and administration there. He treated the local population with justice and tolerance, allowing them to practice their religions and customs. He also introduced Arabic as the official language and promoted Islamic education and culture.
 
Muhammad bin Qasim's conquest of Sind was a significant event in the history of the subcontinent, as it opened the door for further Muslim expansion and influence in the region. It also marked the beginning of a long and complex interaction between Islam and Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and other religions and cultures of the subcontinent.
  
## The Rise and Fall of Various Muslim Dynasties
 
After Muhammad bin Qasim's death in 715 CE, Muslim rule in Sind became weak and unstable, facing resistance from local rulers and invaders from Central Asia. It was not until the 10th century CE that another wave of Muslim invasions began, led by Mahmud of Ghazni, the ruler of Ghaznavid Empire. He raided various parts of northern India, especially Punjab and Gujarat, plundering temples and cities and spreading Islam among some of the people. He also established his capital at Lahore and patronized scholars, poets, artists, and architects.
 
Mahmud's successors were unable to maintain his empire and faced challenges from other Muslim dynasties, such as the Ghurids, who conquered Ghazni in 1186 CE. The Ghurids were responsible for overthrowing the Hindu kingdoms of Prithviraj Chauhan and Jayachandra in northern India, paving the way for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 CE. The Delhi Sultanate was the first Muslim empire that ruled over most of India for over three centuries. It was divided into five dynasties: the Mamluks, the Khaljis, the Tughlaqs, the Sayyids, and the Lodis. The Delhi Sultans faced many challenges from internal rebellions, external invasions, regional kingdoms, and religious movements. They also contributed to the development of administration, law, trade, architecture, literature, art, and culture in India.
 
The Delhi Sultanate came to an end in 1526 CE when Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan, defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the Battle of Panipat. Babur founded the Mughal Empire, which reached its zenith under Akbar, who ruled from 1556 to 1605 CE. Akbar was known for his religious tolerance, political reforms, military conquests, cultural patronage, and artistic achievements. He also tried to create a new religion called Din-i-Ilahi, which combined elements of Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Sikhism. His successors included Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, who expanded and consolidated the empire but also faced many problems from rebellions, wars, corruption, intolerance, and decline.
 
The Mughal Empire gradually weakened after Aurangzeb's death in 1707 CE and was replaced by various regional powers
