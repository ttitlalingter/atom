1. Tap âForgot Pattern.â Now you'll see a Google login screen.
2. Sign in with your Google username and password. Make sure you are using the username and password for the Google account that's associated with this phone. An email will be sent to the Gmail account to confirm your identity.

4. Click the link in the message from Google. The email contains a link that you must click to confirm that you are who you say you are. If you don't remember your Google password, visit [https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery](https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery) in a web browser.
5. Tap âSettingsâ in the app drawer. Now that you're back into your phone, you can set a new unlock pattern.
6. Select âLock Screen.â This option appears under the âPersonalizationâ section of the Settings menu. This will bring you to the âLock Screenâ menu.[^2^]
7. Select âScreen Security.â This is the first option under the âGeneralâ heading.
8. Tap âScreen Lock.â Now you'll see a menu containing the different methods of locking your screen.
9. Select âPattern.â Now you'll see a list of different pattern sizes (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5). The option you select determines the amount of dots on which you'll draw your pattern. For example, if you pick 4x4, the unlock screen will show 4 columns of dots and 4 rows of dots.
10. Tap a size and draw your pattern. When the dots appear, drag your finger across the dots in your desired pattern. If you make a mistake, tap âRetry.â
11. Tap âContinueâ and confirm your pattern. Now you'll have to redraw the pattern, just to make sure it matches.
12. Tap âConfirmâ to set the pattern. As long as the two patterns match, you'll return to the Screen Security menu. The next time you unlock your phone, use the pattern you just created.
