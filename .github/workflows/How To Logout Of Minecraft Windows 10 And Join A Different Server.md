1. Launch Minecraft from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
2. Click on the profile icon in the top right corner of the screen. This will open a drop-down menu with your account details.
3. Click on the "Sign Out" button at the bottom of the menu. This will log you out of your Microsoft account and return you to the main menu.
4. If you want to logout of your Mojang account as well, click on the "Settings" button in the bottom left corner of the screen. This will open the game settings menu.
5. Click on the "Profile" tab on the left side of the menu. This will show your Mojang account information.
6. Click on the "Unlink" button next to your username. This will unlink your Mojang account from your Windows 10 device and log you out of the game.

Now you have successfully logged out of Minecraft Windows 10. You can log back in with the same or a different account whenever you want to play again.
  
Logging out of Minecraft Windows 10 is a simple and quick process that can help you keep your account secure and your game data safe. However, there are some things you should know before you logout of the game.
 
First, logging out of your Microsoft account will not delete your game data or your worlds. Your game data is stored locally on your device and in the cloud, so you can access it again when you log back in. However, if you logout of your Mojang account, you will lose access to any online features that require a Mojang account, such as Realms, servers, and cross-play. You will also lose access to any skins, textures, or add-ons that you have purchased or downloaded from the Minecraft Marketplace.
 
Second, logging out of Minecraft Windows 10 will not close the game or stop it from running in the background. If you want to exit the game completely, you need to click on the "Quit Game" button in the main menu or press the Alt+F4 keys on your keyboard. This will close the game window and free up your device's resources.
 
Third, logging out of Minecraft Windows 10 will not affect your other devices or platforms that you play Minecraft on. You can still play Minecraft on your Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, mobile device, or Java edition with the same or a different account. However, if you want to sync your game data across different devices or platforms, you need to log in with the same Microsoft account on all of them.
